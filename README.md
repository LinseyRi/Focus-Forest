# Focus Forest 
A web based app to motivate you to focus by timing your concentrated time, and growing a virtual forest as a reward. 

## Description 
A basic beginner app built in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project was built in order to practice and demonstrate core programming knowledge, such as functions, interacting with the DOM, and styling web pages. 

This version of the project features a timer which triggers the creation of a 'tree' icon in the 'forest' area of the page at a given interval - currently every one minute, but this interval can be amended at lines 49-51 in the script.js file. 

Going forward, this programme intends to implement a "town builder" functionality, where users will unlock different buildings that they can choose to place around the forest. The longer the user's focus time, the more elaborate the unlocked building. This functionality will practice use of onclick events. Furthermore, the size of the available 'forest' area is due to be expanded.  

### How to install and run the project 
This project can be accessed online [via this link](https://linseyri.github.io/Focus-Forest/).

Alternatively, the project can be downloaded and hosted locally. The project is run via the index.html file. Once the three files are downloaded, the page can be hosted through a simple local server. 

### How to use the project 
Once the user clicks start, the timer will begin. Every one minute a tree will be added to the forest area, currently to a maximum of 16 minutes. A user may press pause to temporarily stop the timer. The reset button can be used to clear both the timer and the existing forest board.
